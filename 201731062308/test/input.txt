Well, sometimes I think knowledge is more important than salary,
smile is more important than face,
happiness is more important than love,
no matter what, you have to cherry.
I don't like rainy days,
but I like the sound of rain,
just like I'm a person who loves to laugh,
but I'm not a happy person,
just kidding, I am a happy person!
